    <h3>How to Make Cochinita Pibil</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Poke holes all over the pork with a fork. Rub achiote paste all over the pork, and set aside.<br> 
            In a large bowl, mix together the orange juice, lemon juice, and habanero peppers.<br> 
            Mix in the cumin, paprika, chili powder, coriander, salt and pepper.<br> 
            Place pork in the mixture, cover, and refrigerate overnight, turning two or three times.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).<br>
            Wrap the pork and marinade in aluminum foil or banana leaves that have been soaked in water for 30 minutes.<br> 
            Place into a casserole dish, and cover.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Bake for about 2 hours, until the meat falls off the bone.<br> 
            The slower you cook it, the better it is.<br> 
            You could also bake it in a 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) oven for 4 or 5 hours,<br> 
            or in a slow cooker without the foil or leaves.</li>
            <br>
        <li>While the pork is cooking, make the sauce.<br> 
            Bring the red wine vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan.<br> 
            Add onions, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender.<br> 
            Pour sauce over pork, and serve with white rice and corn tortillas.<br> 
            Each person can make tacos or fajitas with the pork, the rice and the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
